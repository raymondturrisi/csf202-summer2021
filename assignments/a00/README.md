# Assignment 00: Setup

Your goal for this assignment is to simply make a student account on the [Immersive Labs](https://immersivelabs.com/) platform and provide free online access to the textbook.

The table of contents for this assignment is found below.

Part 1: Immersive Labs Setup<br>
Part 2: O'Reilly Safari Setup<br>

### Part 1: Immersive Labs

We will be using some of the Immersive Labs modules in our assignments and labs throughout the semester. To access these modules, you will need to create a student account with your academic email (@uri.edu).

You can get started by going to their [student registration page](https://dca.immersivelabs.online/register?utm_campaign=Lite&utm_source=hs_automation&utm_medium=email&utm_content=77205243&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_6P5BipCQQB1wVs0DQXh3Nuc2sKRaNXqR-l4VQxSZHvTUkAwtEZRrTSh_qmbOqIdp7UbUaUBgDRc1vWYVnb0bLTCN55A&_hsmi=77205243) and creating a student account with your university email.

Once you have an account and can access all of the Immersive Labs modules, you should be all set!

### Part 2: O'Reilly Safari Setup

O'Reilly Safari is an online service provided by URI that gives you access to thousands of eBooks and other educational content. Through O'Reilly, you will be able to access your A+ textbook for free! To get started, [visit their registration page](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/temporary-access/). Click the "select your institution" dropdown menu and select *Not listed? Click here*. Enter your @uri.edu email account and log in! Once you've created an account, you should be able to access your textbook by simply logging in via the normal landing page at https://www.oreilly.com/

> Note: You can download the O'Reilly Safari app for iOS or Android devices so you can catch up on your homework this semester on the go!

Once you are in O'Reilly Safari, simply search for our textbook *CompTIA A+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, Tenth Edition (Exams 220-1001 & 220-1002), 10th Edition* in the search bar. Once you find it you can bookmark it or add it to a playlist for a quick and easy find next time.

That's all for A00! Nothing to submit on Brightspace for this assignment ~ it's ungraded. However, these two tools will make your life a lot easer this semester, so get to know them well!
